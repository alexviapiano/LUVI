									<ul class="actions">Carrini Beauty Salon opened her business more than 25 years ago. You need a lot of guts to go into business in your early twenties, but Lucy Viapano just followed her instinct. “I’ve been interested in hairstyling from a very early age” remembers the owner. “I started with my dolls, then moved on to my friends and family. It’s really a passion for me. I am lucky to have a job that makes the world happy”. De Carrini is a true beauty salon, with services including make-up, manicures and pedicures, and hair styling, cutting and coloring. Their affordable prices make it a perfect place to visit for a special occasion or as a simple pick-me-up in your busy life.

										Hairdressers for men, women and children are available with or without an appointment. Most of the 18 members of their team have been working there for about 20 years, but they remain on the cutting edge of industry trends. “Without them, I would not be where I am” says Lucy Viapano. Their clientele is really varied: some are just passers-by attracted to the beautiful window, while others are regulars who have been coming to the salon for years. In some cases, Ms. Viapano is on her third generation of customers, and has been a constant presence in the special moments of their lives, from their graduation to their wedding!</p>
